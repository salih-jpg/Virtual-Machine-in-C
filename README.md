# Virtual-Machine-in-C
A program will be a read-only sequence of instructions. The virtual machine is a stack-based virtual machine, which means that it has a stack we can push and pop values to, and a few registers we can use too. These are also a lot more simpler to implement than a register-based virtual machine.
